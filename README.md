# Introduction to C++ and OOPS, Variables, Data Types, I/O Operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **IDE:** VS Code

## üìö Theory

### üîπ Overview
This experiment serves as an introduction to the C++ programming language, focusing on:
- The structure and syntax of a basic C++ program
- Standard Input/Output operations
- Variable declaration and usage
- Data types in C++
- Simple arithmetic operations using operators

---

### Program 1: `exp1A.cpp` - Basic C++ Structure
This program prints a simple message **"Hello, World!"** to demonstrate:
- Basic syntax
- Use of `#include`, `main()` function
- Output using `cout`

---

### Program 2: `exp1B.cpp` - Arithmetic Calculator
This program performs basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on two user-input numbers. It uses:
- Input via `cin`
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Arithmetic operators
- Error handling for division by zero

### üßÆ Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read first number
3. Read operator
4. Read second number
5. Perform operation based on operator:
   - Add if `+`
   - Subtract if `-`
   - Multiply if `*`
   - Divide if `/` and divisor ‚â† 0
6. Display result or error message
7. End

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This experiment introduces me to the fundamental building blocks of C++:
- Writing and compiling C++ code
- Performing input/output operations
- Using arithmetic and logical constructs

These programs lay the foundation for further learning in Object-Oriented Programming and advanced C++ features.
